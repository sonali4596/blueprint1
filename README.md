#PROBLEMS AND HOW I OVERCOME:
There was no such big problem which I faced during the making of this project but here is one
which I analysed and I tried different way   
1)the first problem which I faced with BLOB in the database as it was making it slow .
  so I used alternative way of storing image in database.
  the path was given in the database and the image was stored in the system itself .
